            <p class="whiteTxt aboutInfo tab">  My name is Daniel Wilson, I am 19 years of age and I did my first HTML code in the 9th grade. Since that time I have had a on again off again relationship with Web Development. That is until last year when I decided I wanted to pursure it as a carrer. I enrolled into FullStack Academy's Web development bootcamp and never looked back.</p><br>
            <p class="whiteTxt aboutInfo tab">When I am not futhering my skills in coding I like to be physically active. I play sports such as basketball and do free weight training five days a week. I played varsity basketball in a 5A division this had helped me to develop many skills not only related to programming, but regarding every aspect of life as well. When I'm not being active or programming I am finding a new video game to enjoy.</p>
